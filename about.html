				<p>The business of beauty salon in Nigeria is, on the whole, potentially lucrative. The country’s population which is currently estimated to be well over 170 million presents great opportunities for investors in the beauty and personal care industry. A large section of its teeming population is young and places great value on looking good. Demand for skin care, oral care and hair treatment products, makeup and fragrances from a growing middle class have also soared. This trend is expected to continue in the next few decades, despite constraints such as complicated distribution networks, insufficient or unavailable standards specifications, and general production and marketing constraints.</p>
				<p>Nigeria’s beauty industry is vibrant and expanding. There has been a sustained growth in the sector despite economic challenges, even as population and cultural changes tend in directions which favor market expansion.</p>
